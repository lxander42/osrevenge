                <h3>Wiki</h3>
                <p>OSRevenge is a free and open source reverse engineering database for mechanical parts. Our mission is
                    to create a community-driven platform where engineers and makers can collaborate and share knowledge
                    about the design and manufacturing of mechanical parts.</p>
